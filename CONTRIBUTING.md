# Welcome to the CivicTechJobs Contributing Guide

> Note: This guide is for developers. If you are looking to contribute as a project manager, UI designer or UX researcher, please [join our organization as a volunteer](https://github.com/hackforla/CivicTechJobs/wiki/Joining-the-Team) and then request to join our team!

Thank you for investing your time to our project. Anything you contribute will be reflected on our repository at [hackforla/civictechjobs](https://github.com/hackforla/CivicTechJobs).

Before starting, make sure you read our [code of conduct](https://github.com/hackforla/codeofconduct). Also, consider [joining our team as a volunteer](https://github.com/hackforla/CivicTechJobs/wiki/Joining-the-Team), especially if you enjoyed contributing to us. This gives you access to our developer meetings and slack channel so that you can influence the direction of the project on a much greater level.

This guide outlines the three ways you can contribute to us as a developer: creating issues, resolving issues, or reviewing a pull requests. Moreover, this guide is split into freelancer and development team sections. Feel free to skip to the section that you feel is most relevant for you!

Pro tip: Use the table of contents in the top-left corner to jump to specific sections of this guide.

## Contributing to our project (for freelancers)

### Creating Issues

We do not currently have a dedicated issue template for creating issues for contributors outside of our team. For now, please [open a blank issue](https://github.com/hackforla/CivicTechJobs/issues/new) and describe your inquiry as best as you can. Once you are finished, [add your newly opened issue to our Project Management project board](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/tracking-work-with-project-boards/adding-issues-and-pull-requests-to-a-project-board#adding-issues-and-pull-requests-to-a-project-board-from-the-sidebar).

### Resolving Issues

> **Note: Make sure to check out our [installation instructions](https://hackforla.github.io/CivicTechJobs-Documentation/developer/installation/) to set up your development environment before working on any issues!**

1. Find a developer issue to work on from our [prioritized backlog](https://github.com/hackforla/CivicTechJobs/projects/1#column-10928271). (Hint: look for the `frontend` or `backend` label). The `size` label will signal the amount of work the issue might involve, with a higher number indicating greater work. For a first time contributor, we recommend taking issues with the `good first issue` label or a `size` of 1 or 2.
2. [From your local repository, create a branch off of main.](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell)
3. Make changes to the project on that branch based on your issue.
4. [Create a pull request from your fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork). After you had opened the pull request, there will be instructions on the [pull request template](https://github.com/hackforla/CivicTechJobs/blob/main/.github/pull_request_template.md?plain=1) for you to follow.
5. Done! Now just wait for a team member to get back to you with feedback on your changes!

> Important note 1: **We do not want to be flooded with pull requests!** Please, do **NOT** take on another issue or open a second pull request until your current pull request and linked issue are resolved by a team member.

> Important note 2: **Do not directly contact the team to review your pull request unless it has been over 72 hours since the pull request was opened.** As an open-source project, the team contribute to the project in their free time, which varies from week to week, day to day. We will, however, gladly answer any and all questions you may have.

## Contributing to our project (for members of our dev team)

### Creating Issues

To create an issue as a member of our team, locate the appropriate template for your issue from the [new issue screen](https://github.com/hackforla/CivicTechJobs/issues/new/choose). Typically, you will not go wrong with [Blank Issue](https://github.com/hackforla/CivicTechJobs/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=blank-issue.md&title=) or the [form version](https://github.com/hackforla/CivicTechJobs/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=blank-issue-form.yml). If you need help, feel free to consult your development lead or other members of the team. Once you are finished, [add your newly opened issue to our Project Management project board](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/tracking-work-with-project-boards/adding-issues-and-pull-requests-to-a-project-board#adding-issues-and-pull-requests-to-a-project-board-from-the-sidebar).

### Resolving Issues

> **Note: Make sure to check out our [installation instructions](https://hackforla.github.io/CivicTechJobs-Documentation/developer/installation/) to set up your development environment before working on any issues!**

1. Find a developer issue to work on from our [prioritized backlog](https://github.com/hackforla/CivicTechJobs/projects/1#column-10928271). (Hint: look for the `frontend` or `backend` label). The `size` label will signal the amount of work the issue might involve, with a higher number indicating greater work. For a development team member, we encourage taking the topmost `frontend` or `backend` issue, as they are arranged by priority by role.
2. Assign yourself to the issue. (Hint: see [step 4](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/assigning-issues-and-pull-requests-to-other-github-users#assigning-an-individual-issue-or-pull-request).)
3. Move the issue from the prioritized backlog to the [in progress](https://github.com/hackforla/CivicTechJobs/projects/1#column-10928272) column. (Hint, see [step 5](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/tracking-work-with-project-boards/adding-issues-and-pull-requests-to-a-project-board#adding-issues-and-pull-requests-to-a-project-board-from-the-sidebar).)

> Important note 1: **We do not want to be flooded with pull requests!** Please, do **NOT** take on another issue or open a second pull request until your current pull request and linked issue are resolved by a team member. To take on another issue, please ask the development lead for an appropriate additional issue to take on.

> Important note 2: **Do not directly contact the team to review your pull request unless it has been over 72 hours since the pull request was opened.** As an open-source project, the team contribute to the project in their free time, which varies from week to week, day to day. Feel free to ask any questions, however!

### Reviewing Code

To review code, please take a look at this [guide from another project](https://github.com/hackforla/website/wiki/How-to-Review-Pull-Requests). Not all the information there will be relevant to this project, but it should nonetheless get you started.

### Error Messages

<summary>1. error: insufficient permission for adding an object to repository database </summary>

You must have created a new file, through Docker. Since this file "belongs" to the container, you need to transfer permission by running, <code>sudo chown -R $USER:$USER .</code>. (See <a href='https://docs.docker.com/samples/django/#create-a-django-project'>step 3</a> for more info.)
