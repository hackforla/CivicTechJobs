# Welcome to the CivicTechJobs Contributing Guide

> Note: This guide is for developers. If you are looking to contribute as a project manager, UI designer or UX researcher, please [join our organization as a volunteer](https://github.com/hackforla/CivicTechJobs/wiki/Joining-the-Team) and then request to join our team!

Thank you for investing your time to our project. Anything you contribute will be reflected on our repository at [hackforla/civictechjobs](https://github.com/hackforla/CivicTechJobs).

Before starting, make sure you read our [code of conduct](https://github.com/hackforla/codeofconduct). Also, consider [joining our team as a volunteer](https://github.com/hackforla/CivicTechJobs/wiki/Joining-the-Team), especially if you enjoyed contributing to us. This gives you access to our developer meetings and slack channel so that you can influence the direction of the project on a much greater level.

This guide outlines the three ways you can contribute to us as a developer: creating issues, resolving issues, or reviewing a pull requests as either a team member or freelancer.

Pro tip: Use the table of contents in the top-left corner to jump to specific sections of this guide.

## Contributing to our project

Note: "(team member)" and "(freelancer)" are used at the beginning of an instruction to identify a step specific to one or the other.

### Creating Issues

Locate the appropriate template for your issue from the [new issue screen](https://github.com/hackforla/CivicTechJobs/issues/new/choose) or by clicking  the New Issue button from the [Issues tab](https://github.com/hackforla/CivicTechJobs/issues).  The [Blank Issue](https://github.com/hackforla/CivicTechJobs/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=blank-issue.md&title=) or the more detailed [form version](https://github.com/hackforla/CivicTechJobs/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=blank-issue-form.yml) are always appropriate. 

(team member) If you need help, feel free to consult your development lead or other members of the team. 

### Resolving Issues

> **Note: Make sure to check out our [installation instructions](https://hackforla.github.io/CivicTechJobs/developer/installation/) to set up your development environment before working on any issues!**

1. Find a developer issue to work on from our [prioritized backlog](https://github.com/hackforla/CivicTechJobs/projects/1#column-10928271). (Hint: look for the `frontend` or `backend` label). The `size` label will signal the amount of work the issue might involve, with a higher number indicating greater work. We encourage you to take the topmost `frontend` or `backend` issue, as they are arranged by priority by role.
2. Indicate you are working on the issue as follows:
   - (team member) Assign yourself to the issue. (Hint: see [step 4 of this GitHub article](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/assigning-issues-and-pull-requests-to-other-github-users#assigning-an-individual-issue-or-pull-request).)
   - (freelancer) If you expect the issue will take more than a day to complete, add a comment to the bug indicating you are working on the bug 
3. (team member) Move the issue from the prioritized backlog to the [in progress](https://github.com/hackforla/CivicTechJobs/projects/1#column-10928272) column. (Hint, see [step 5 of this GitHub article](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/tracking-work-with-project-boards/adding-issues-and-pull-requests-to-a-project-board#adding-issues-and-pull-requests-to-a-project-board-from-the-sidebar).)
4. [From your local fork, create a branch off of main.](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell)
5. Make changes on that branch for your issue.
6. [Create a pull request from your fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork). After you had opened the pull request, there will be instructions on the [pull request template](https://github.com/hackforla/CivicTechJobs/blob/main/.github/pull_request_template.md?plain=1) for you to follow.
7. Check that all the automated checks have passed.  This is at the bottom of the pull request.
8. Done! Now just wait for a team member to get back to you with feedback on your changes!  <br/>
(team member) To take on another issue, please ask the development lead for an appropriate additional issue to take on.

> Important note 1: **We do not want to be flooded with pull requests!** Please, do **NOT** take on another issue or open a second pull request until your current pull request and linked issue are resolved by a team member. 

> Important note 2: **Do not directly contact the team to review your pull request unless it has been over 72 hours since the pull request was opened.** As an open-source project, the team contribute to the project in their free time, which varies from week to week, day to day. Feel free to ask any questions, however!

### Reviewing Code

To review code, please take a look at this [guide from another project](https://github.com/hackforla/website/wiki/How-to-Review-Pull-Requests). Not all the information there will be relevant to this project, but it should nonetheless get you started.

### Error Messages

<summary>1. error: insufficient permission for adding an object to repository database </summary>

You must have created a new file, through Docker. Since this file "belongs" to the container, you need to transfer permission by running, <code>sudo chown -R $USER:$USER .</code>. (See <a href='https://docs.docker.com/samples/django/#create-a-django-project'>step 3</a> for more info.)
