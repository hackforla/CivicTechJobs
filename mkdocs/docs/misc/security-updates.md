# Security Updates

This project subscribes to GitHub's automated security alerting service. Occasionally the repository home page may have a yellow banner saying "We have found a potential security vulnerability in one of your dependencies" and a link to view the security alert. If you see this, please check our issues list to see if anyone has added an issue for fixing this. If not, please create an issue for this problem. If you feel up to it, please assign the issue to yourself and try to fix it. As with any issue, once you have fixed it on your fork of the repository, push the fixes to your fork and then open a pull request to merge this fix into the main repository.

**GitHub's "dependabot" may try to generate an automated pull request to fix this issue. Please do not accept this pull request without verifying that it works by applying the update on your local copy of the site.**
