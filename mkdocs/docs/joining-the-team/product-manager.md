Each of the resources below can be considered a work-in-progress. These resources will evolve and adapt as the team and team needs change. Feel free to open an issue with a link to whichever resource needs improvement and a description of the suggested change.

1. Learn how we setup our [GitHub Kanban boards](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11Fe7mNdmPBP5bD_yLJ1C0_I1TmoK47AuHHrdhdDyWCs/edit?usp=sharing) and please comment if there is anything in the document that is unclear.

2. This [Software Development Lifecycle Diagram](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1emxhYv9N6KuCVrG-gnqkqHdGnjhm_Qvb/view?usp=sharing) is a sample of what the process is generally like at Hack for LA and each project is different.

3. Review our [OKRS](INSERT-PROJECT-OKRS-SPREADSHEET-LINK).

4. Communicate with other product team members and leadership to discuss project priorities and strategic direction.

5. Review the [Project Board](https://github.com/hackforla/[INSERT-REPO-NAME]/projects/1) and the [Product Management issues available on that board](https://hackforla/[INSERT-REPO-NAME]/projects/1?card_filter_query=label%3A%22role%3A+product%2Fproject+mgmt%22) to identify an actionable backlog item.
