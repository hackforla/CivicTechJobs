# Welcome to the Civictechjobs.org Wiki!

## Project Definition

CivicTechJobs will be a site to find open volunteer positions for projects at hackforla.

## Introduction To The Project

### What is Civictechjobs.org?

CivicTechJobs will be a platform to help prospective volunteers find interdisciplinary projects that will be useful for their career development while contributing to positive civic impact, and also a CMS (Content Mgmt System) for Hack for LA projects to be able to list their open roles.

### Why do it?

To match the right volunteers with the right projects at hackforla.

### Hasn't it been done already?

Yes, through CoP GitHub pages. However, the process is cumbersome and involves multiple steps to match the candidate with the right role.

Read more about what lead up to us developing this project, at our [History](History) page.

### So how is this different?

We would like to streamline the process so that Product Managers can post the open oppotunities within their team efficiently, but most importantly a volunteer is able to find the right match with a project based on their skills, and aspirations.

## Guiding Objectives

### What are our guiding objectives?

1. Provide product managers ability to post, edit, or close open positions on an easy to use instinctive site (CMS)
2. Assist potential volunteers to self-filter for roles that matches their availability
3. Provide potential volunteers list of open roles with different projects that matches their skills, and interest.
