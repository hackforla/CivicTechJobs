## Summary

**Backend Tech Stack**: Django, DjangoRESTFramework

The backend architecture is consists the `docker/` directory, the Django `config/` project, the `frontend/` and `server/` Django apps, and a couple of Django or Docker-related loose files. In addition to serving as part of our backend, the `frontend/` directory also serves our frontend architecture. More about the `frontend/` directory as it relates our frontend architecture can be found in our guide on [Frontend Architecture](../../developer/frontend/).

## Overview of Directories and Files

- **config/:** houses the Django project files.
  - **<Django Project Files\>:** More on the files in this directory can be found in [Django's documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/).
- **<Django App\>:** currently we have two directories that are Django apps: `frontend/` and `server/`. Within these directories are the default `<Django App Files>` that are created with every app as well as `<RESTFramework Files>`.
  - **<Django App Files\>:** These files make up a Django App. To know more about these apps, read the section about [Django App Files](#django-app-files).
  - **<RESTFramework Files\>:** Currently consists of only `serializers.py`, these files are additional files that support Django via the [DjangoRestFramework library](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/).
- **manage.py:** Part of Django, this is the entry point file for starting the Django server. This file handles a lot of critical settings, so be sure to read up on it in [Django's documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/django-admin/).
- **requirements.txt:** A Python file that contains all dependencies for a project. It is the Python equivalent to Javascript's `package.json`.

As of right now, no specific changes have been made to these files, so please refer to [Django's documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/) for now to learn what they do in a general sense.

## Django REST Framework Files

As of right now, no specific changes have been made to these files, so please refer to [DjangoRESTFramework's documentation](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) for now to learn what they do in a general sense.
